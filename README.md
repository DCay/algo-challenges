## Short Intro

During my free time, I like to code different stuff, which vary from basic algorithms, to web applications.
I really do not have interest only in a particular part of software development.
My interests are rather... wide and chaotic.
Programming is my hoby. I don't do it for the money or fame or anything. I do it for fun, which is why
I can find interest in any part of it.

## Description

This repo is made solely for the data structures and algorithms challenges I put my mind to.
